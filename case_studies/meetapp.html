        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>MeetApp is a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) created with React and built through a test-driven
          development
          (TDD) methodology. This application implements the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming tech events at
          various
          locations around the world giving a date, time, and description of the event. The app also employs data
          visualizations to show the frequency of events amongst the different locations around the world.</p>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Meet App was created as a learning project aimed at deepening my proficiency in React, exploring serverless
          technology, and embracing Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodologies. The project was an attempt to build a
          more ambitious web application that I could add to my professional portfolio.</p>
        <h2>Methodologies</h2>
        <p>React, AWS Lambda, Google Calendar API, jest, jest-cucumber, Atatus for APM, PWA, Recharts.</p>

        <h3>Serverless and oAuth</h3>
        <p>The foundation of Meet App’s backend was laid on servlerless architecture using AWS lambda. Serverless
          computing was chosen because it enables the application to respond dynamically to fluctuating user
          demand without the need for managing servers allowing me to focus solely on application logic. The initial
          implementation of serverless into my project was challenging, but after some time and effort I was able to
          gain a better understanding of the logic involved and successfully incorporated it into the application. The
          serverless functions were used to set up oAuth and allow users to sign in with their own accounts.</p>

      <h3 class="testing-title">Testing</h3>
      <div class="testing-content">
        <ul class="test-types">
          <li><b class="test-li">Unit Testing: </b>In order to maintain code quality and reliability of Meet App,
            comprehensive unit
            testing was implemented. Unit tests were written to validate individual components within the application
            such as rendering the events. Adopting unit testing practices helped in identifying and resolving bugs
            earlier on.</li>
          <li><b class="test-li">Integration Testing: </b>Integration testing played a crucial role in validating the
            interactions between Meet App’s various components and processes. By conducting these tests I was able to
            ensure overall stability of the app.</li>
          <li><b class="test-li">User-Acceptance Testing: </b>User acceptance testing was conducted to assess Meet app’s
            usability and adherence to user requirements. Scenarios were simulated to evaluate the applications
            responsiveness and feature functionality. This played a key role in refining the user experience and
            addressing any usability issues before deployment.</li>

            <p>One of the core functionalities of Meet App is its ability to be used as a progressive web app (PWA).
              This
              offers to the user a native app-like experience as well as the ability to use the application offline and
              also
              allows push notifications. I used Google’s lighthouse to evaluate Meet App’s aptitude as a PWA and once
              the
              service worker and web-app manifest was installed it passed with the criteria needed.</p>

        <div class="data-viz">
          <h3 class="data-viz-header">Data Visualization</h3>
          <p>Data visualization played a significant role in providing insights to the user about the frequency of the
            queried events. In Meet App I used a modern visualization library called Recharts to present users with
            information about various meetups in the selected regions in a visual manner. </p>

    <div class="conclusion">
      <h2 class="conclusion-title">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The development of Meet App allowed me to familiarize myself with several new technologies and methodologies. I
        learned how to transform a prospective project’s feature requirements into user stories and subsequently
        translate those user stories into gherkin syntax. The gherkin syntax then laid the foundation for the tests that
        needed to be coded for the project throughout its development. After comprehensively testing the app through
        unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing, Meet App was validated for its functionality. This
        project had many challenges from setting up the serverless environment to creating the PWA functionality. If I
        were to attempt a similarly ambitious project again I would limit the amount of new technologies involved. It
        was difficult at first to conceptualize all the abstractions, but after putting a significant amount of
        time and effort into understanding all the moving parts of the project it became easier.</p>
